    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>
        Sienna grew up in a hoarder's house with many other cats, scavenging for food, until she was rescued by the RSPCA.
        We adopted her from the RSPCA and she promptly hid under the oven.
        She slowly gained confidence until she became the snuggle-loving, tap-demanding cat we know and love today.
    </p>

    <h3>Daily Routine</h3>
    <p>
        Sienna's daily routine starts with excessively meowing at the first person up to prepare her tuna/salmon and supplement.
        Then, she will either lie on my bed or windowsill for some sunbathing for most of the morning.
        Occasionally she will catch someone at a sink and demand tap water, or sometimes bother someone to hold her while they try to do work.
